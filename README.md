<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project is to create a Python program that will gather input and options from the End User, and then based on those options sync files between two folder locations.

The options to gather from the End User will be:
* How to present the data
* If the End User wants a report generated, and what format to generate that report in (print to screen, or .txt)
* Input the folders the End User wants to sync between
* Add those folders to a CONFIG file for easy selection next time
* Choose if you want to PUSH from 1 folder to the next, PULL from 1 folder to the next, or do both
* Write a log of all the actions performed


### Built With
